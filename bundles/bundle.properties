status.exotic-mod-0b-condenser-turbines.details = You managed to hook a water condenser and a better shaft to your turbines, allowing [#7382f0]water to recirculate[] back to your heaters.
status.exotic-mod-0b-wormhole-beacons.name = Wormhole Beacons
status.exotic-mod-0b-wormhole-beacons.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nAfter attempting to upgrade your Nexus' antenna, you managed to instead create an [#7382f0]interdimensional broadcast antenna.[]\n\nThese antennae can be used to [#7382f0]call in warden reinforcements[], with different broadcasting frequency meshes calling in different starships.\nCoolant for such a broadcast is hard to integrate, leading to antennae [#e65555]overheating after a single use.[] 
status.exotic-mod-0b-fleet-beacons.name = Fleet Beacons
status.exotic-mod-0b-fleet-beacons.details = With some work, and some analysis of high-capacity coolant systems, you have managed to find a way to [#7382f0]cool simpler beacons[] and allow repeated broadcasts.\n\nYou can now [#7382f0]call in full fleets of smaller starships[], or [#7382f0]reliably call in more combat-capable warships.[]\n\n\n\nJust don't spam Entulae's DMs.
status.exotic-mod-0b-payload-launching.name = Payload Launching 
status.exotic-mod-0b-payload-launching.details = While putting time into research, you played with payloads, managing to make some interesting adaptations to your current tech.\n\nPayload networks allow for [#7382f0]high-throughput distribution[] of items and liquids. Many [#7382f0]later game factories[] require such throughput to function.
status.exotic-mod-0b-advanced-production.name = Advanced Production
status.exotic-mod-0b-advanced-production.details = On successfully integrating higher capacity parts into your factories, you sought to [#7382f0]increase their output and efficiency[] in the process.\n\nThese large, industrial grade structures [#7382f0]take many resources to operate.[]
